# A basic Python program that sets up a social influence modeling simulation to study how individuals influence each other's behavior within a social system
# In this program, we create a simple social influence modeling simulation where agents influence each other's beliefs. 
# Each agent has an initial belief, and in each iteration, an agent gets influenced by another random agent within the system. 
# The influence rate determines how much the beliefs change based on interaction. 
# You can further develop this model by incorporating more complex influence mechanisms, network structures, and behavior dynamics to study social influence in more depth.

import numpy as np

# Parameters
num_agents = 100
num_iterations = 50
influence_rate = 0.1

# Initialize agent beliefs
beliefs = np.random.rand(num_agents)

# Simulate social influence
for _ in range(num_iterations):
    for i in range(num_agents):
        other_agent = np.random.choice(num_agents)  # Select a random agent to get influenced by
        beliefs[i] += (beliefs[other_agent] - beliefs[i]) * influence_rate

# Analyze the final beliefs of the agents
for i, belief in enumerate(beliefs):
    print(f"Agent {i + 1}: Final Belief - {belief}")
