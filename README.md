Complex soscial systems is very rare topic. It entails combining dynamical systems behaviour with social science notions. 

This project uses AI code capabilities to perform simple tasks on complex social systems modelling activity

Ten main areas where also AI identify: 
1. Social Network Analysis: Developing algorithms to analyze social networks, identify key influencers, detect communities, etc.
2. Opinion Dynamics: Simulating how opinions evolve within a population over time, considering factors like persuasion, influence, and social interactions.
3. Game Theory: Implementing game-theoretic models to study strategic interactions and decision-making in social contexts.
4. Agent-Based Modeling: Creating simulations where individual agents interact within a larger social system, allowing for emergent behavior to be observed.
5. Epidemiological Modeling: Building models to simulate the spread of diseases within a population, considering factors like contact networks, transmission rates, and interventions.
6. Sentiment Analysis: Developing algorithms to analyze and classify sentiment in social media data, such as tweets or comments.
7. Recommendation Systems: Designing systems to recommend items (e.g., books, movies, products) to users based on their preferences and social network connections.
8. Community Detection: Implementing algorithms to identify communities or clusters within social networks, based on patterns of connections or interactions.
9. Social Influence Modeling: Building models to understand how individuals influence each other's behavior, beliefs, and decisions within a social system.
10. Collaborative Filtering: Creating algorithms to make predictions or recommendations based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users within a social system.

Taylor made code programming activity might use this initial templates as a quick short basis provided by AI.
