# Here is a basic Python program that implements a simple epidemiological modeling simulation to simulate the spread of a disease within a population
# This program sets up a simple epidemiological model to simulate the spread of a disease within a population, considering factors like transmission rates and recovery rates. 
# You can extend this model by incorporating more complex disease dynamics, contact networks, interventions, and analysis techniques based on your specific requirements.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
population_size = 1000
initial_infected = 5
transmission_rate = 0.3
recovery_rate = 0.1

# Initialize the population with states: 0 (susceptible), 1 (infected), 2 (recovered)
population = np.zeros(population_size)
population[:initial_infected] = 1

# Simulate the spread of the disease
for _ in range(100):
    # Infect susceptible individuals based on transmission rate
    new_infections = np.random.rand(population_size) < transmission_rate * np.sum(population == 1) / population_size
    population[(population == 0) & new_infections] = 1

    # Recover infected individuals based on recovery rate
    recoveries = np.random.rand(population_size) < recovery_rate
    population[(population == 1) & recoveries] = 2

# Plot the results
plt.hist(population, bins=[-0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5], color=['blue', 'red', 'green'], alpha=0.7)
plt.xticks([0, 1, 2], ['Susceptible', 'Infected', 'Recovered'])
plt.xlabel('Population State')
plt.ylabel('Number of Individuals')
plt.title('Epidemiological Model Simulation')
plt.show()
