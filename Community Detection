# A Python program that utilizes the NetworkX library to implement a basic community detection model based on the Louvain method, a popular algorithm for detecting communities in networks.

import networkx as nx
import community

# Create a sample social network graph
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community.best_partition(G)

# Print the detected communities
communities = {}
for node, community_id in partition.items():
    if community_id in communities:
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    else:
        communities[community_id] = [node]

for idx, nodes in communities.items():
    print(f"Community {idx + 1}: {nodes}")
