# Here is a basic Python program that sets up a sentiment analysis model to classify sentiment in social media data
# In this program, we use the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on social media data (tweets or comments). 
# The classify_sentiment function uses TextBlob to determine whether a piece of text has a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. 
# You can enhance this model by incorporating more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, training custom sentiment analysis models, and analyzing sentiment trends in social media data.

from textblob import TextBlob

# Function to classify sentiment using TextBlob
def classify_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return "Neutral"
    else:
        return "Negative"

# Sample social media data - tweets or comments
social_media_data = [
    "I love this product! It's amazing ❤️",
    "Neutral opinion on the service provided.",
    "Had a terrible experience with customer support 😡"
]

# Classify sentiment for each data point
for data in social_media_data:
    sentiment = classify_sentiment(data)
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment} - Text: {data}")
