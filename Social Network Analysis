# Here is a basic Python program that sets up a social network analysis model using the NetworkX library

import networkx as nx

# Create a new directed graph
social_network = nx.DiGraph()

# Add nodes representing users
users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]
social_network.add_nodes_from(users)

# Add edges representing relationships/friendships
relationships = [("Alice", "Bob"), ("Alice", "Charlie"), ("Bob", "David"), ("Charlie", "Eve"), ("Eve", "Alice")]
social_network.add_edges_from(relationships)

# Perform social network analysis tasks here such as identifying key influencers, detecting communities, etc.

# For example, to find the key influencers based on degree centrality:
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(social_network)
key_influencers = sorted(degree_centrality, key=degree_centrality.get, reverse=True)
print("Key Influencers:", key_influencers)
