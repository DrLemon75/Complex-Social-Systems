# Here is a basic Python program that sets up a simple game theory model to study strategic interactions between players
# In this program, we define a simple 2-player game with a payoff matrix. Each player selects a strategy, and based on their strategies, they receive corresponding payoffs from the matrix. 
# This model can be expanded by adding more players, strategies, and more complex payoff structures to simulate and analyze strategic interactions and decision-making in social contexts using game theory concepts.

import numpy as np

# Define the payoff matrix for a 2-player game
payoff_matrix = np.array([[3, 0],
                          [5, 1]])

# Define strategies for Player 1 and Player 2
player1_strategy = 0  # Player 1 chooses row 0
player2_strategy = 1  # Player 2 chooses column 1

# Get the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 based on their chosen strategies
player1_payoff = payoff_matrix[player1_strategy, player2_strategy]
player2_payoff = payoff_matrix[player2_strategy, player1_strategy]

# Print the payoffs for each player
print("Player 1 payoff:", player1_payoff)
print("Player 2 payoff:", player2_payoff)
