# Here is a basic Python program that sets up a recommendation system model to recommend items to users based on their preferences
# In this program, we create a simple recommendation system model using item-item collaborative filtering based on user preferences. 
# The program calculates item-item similarity using cosine similarity and recommends items to a user based on their preferences. 
# You can enhance this model by incorporating more advanced recommendation algorithms, handling implicit feedback, and improving recommendation quality based on social network connections or user interactions.


import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample user-item matrix (preferences)
user_item_matrix = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 1],
                             [0, 1, 1, 0],
                             [1, 1, 0, 1]])

# Calculate item-item similarity using cosine similarity
item_item_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_item_matrix.T)

# Recommend items to a user based on their preferences
user_preferences = np.array([1, 0, 1])  # Sample user preferences
recommended_items = np.argmax(np.dot(user_preferences, item_item_similarity))
print("Recommended item:", recommended_items)
